    <h3> Reading Response Portion: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1)</strong> I learned that design can "guide your focus" to a particular section of a website/app. I had never
            really thought about it before, but it makes complete sense that making a section pop could be
            utilized to signal users: <em>"hey! look over here!"</em></li>
        <li><strong>2)</strong >My favorite part of this article was the GIFs used to break down how an app is created, and the intention
            behind each little detail.</li>
        <li><strong>3)</strong> Quote: <em>"The placeholder text in the search bar could have just said “Search here” but instead they 
            mention a specific city. Though I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting."</em>
            This quote made me wonder how much designers must consider humans' neurological responses to 
            the colors, patterns, and ideas they choose to implement.</li>
        <li><strong>4)</strong>The article was interesting, short, and included images and examples: I'll give it a 10 :)!</li>
