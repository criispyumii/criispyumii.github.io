							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The way one's audience will view their website is a key point to consider when creating one.
								There's a variety of different ways in which developers may (accidentally, even) implement potential exclusionary features -- 
							such as relying too heavily on color or lacking contrast. Combating this ensures website/apps are 
							accessible by the largest audience possible. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Being partially-color-blind myself, it was cool to see someone consider how people like me might
								view their product. I think that people are slowly coming to consider a wider range of individuals
								with unique impairments and working to raise awareness. That's always the first step to overcoming an issue! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "In 2017, The World Health Organization estimated that roughly 217 million people live with some form of moderate to severe vision impairment." </p>
